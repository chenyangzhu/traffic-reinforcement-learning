# Multi-agent Traffic Reinforcement Learning using High Frequency Data

In this repo, we provide an easy-to-use RL framework for a general dynamic traffic
light control use. We are now developing our second version. You can download and
use v1.0 [here](https://github.com/chenyangzhu/traffic-reinforcement-learning/releases/tag/v1.0)
